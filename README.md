Archive.org Disk Browser
========================
By Stephen Heumann

This is the Archive.org Disk Browser for the Apple IIGS. It is a Finder extension that lets you conveniently search for disk images on the Internet Archive (archive.org) and mount them on your IIGS.

The Archive.org Disk Browser works in conjunction with [NetDisk][1] and is distributed together with it. For downloads and documentation, go to the NetDisk page.
